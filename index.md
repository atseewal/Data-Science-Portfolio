![MIDAS POSTER pptx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39170343/236527580-5212b5c6-b2d1-4275-84c4-d7c425b5284f.png)

#### Description

With cancer as a leading cause of death in the United States, the study of its related data is imperative due to the potential patient benefits. This poster examines the SEER research data of reported cancer diagnoses for the incidence of leukemia in young patients in the United States. The aim is to identify variables, such as prior cancers and treatment, with a unique impact on survival time and five-year survival probabilities using visualizations and different machine learning techniques.

#### Description

My rideshare profitability calculator is a powerful tool for any rideshare driver looking to maximize their earnings. Built using R shiny and deployed to shinyapps.io, this calculator provides quick information on key performance indicators such as if a driver is making money, their effective hourly rate, and how that hourly rate compares to the minimum wage in their state. With reactive indicator boxes, users can quickly assess their earnings relative to their costs, like the cost of gas and insurance for the day. The calculator includes a range of user inputs for detailed exploration of hours worked, miles driven, and take-home pay. Using data visualization, my calculator delivers actionable insights to help drivers optimize their earnings and maximize profitability. With its intuitive interface, this rideshare profitability calculator is a must-have for any driver looking to stay ahead of the competition.

### Tableau Music Chords Visualization

#### Description

Learning piano chords doesn't have to be difficult! Using data visualization, I created a simple way to pull up basic piano chords. It shows which notes are included in the selected chord and lets you change it to a different type of chord. It also uses parameters to change whether the labels on the piano are the finger used to play the note or the name of the note itself.

* _Skills:_ Data visualization, Tableau parameters, Tableau background images, Tableau custom shapes

#### Description

During the 2018 Major League Hacking Local Hack Day, our team was tasked with creating something with the goal of helping the spirit of giving during the holiday season reach those who needed it most. This project, coded and deployed in under 12 hours, was my team's submission.

The goal of GiveR is simple, pair those who have things to give with those who need assistance. The landing page shows the featured organization, and what percentage of need is present during the current month (based on previous data). From here, the sidebar has two sections. There is one for giving. This is where you would go if you had something to donate (time, money, clothes, etc.). You will put in your location, and it will locate places near you that you can donate these goods to.

The other tab is for organizations, and this is where the real power of the application comes from. Organizations fill out their need on a Google form, which then takes these responses and puts them into a Google sheet. This sheet is read directly by the application and feeds the maps in the application.

This application was built using the Shiny package in R, along with Google sheets, Google maps, Google forms, Leaflet (for additional maps) and some HTML/CSS.

### Bernie Sits App

![image](https://github.com/atseewal/data-science-portfolio/assets/39170343/0d40e7f3-9180-4135-8ffb-77cb717fdf6a)

#### Description

A Shiny clone of Nick Sawhney's viral Bernie Sits app!

My version only took an afternoon to put together, but uses R's Shiny package to make some small improvements to the original user interface (UI). It has a more modern look and uses regex and popup notifications to sanitize text for the Streetview API and let users know when they have entered a problematic address.

#### Highlights

* _Code:_ [Bernie Sits - Repository](https://github.com/atseewal/Bernie-Sits-Shiny)

* _Skills:_ UI Design, Image Processing, Google Streetview API, Web Development

* _Technologies:_ R, Shiny, Google Streetview, HTML/CSS, Magick, regex
