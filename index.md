#### Description

With cancer as a leading cause of death in the United States, the study of its related data is imperative due to the potential patient benefits. This poster examines the SEER research data of reported cancer diagnoses for the incidence of leukemia in young patients in the United States. The aim is to identify variables, such as prior cancers and treatment, with a unique impact on survival time and five-year survival probabilities using visualizations and different machine learning techniques.

My rideshare profitability calculator is a powerful tool for any rideshare driver looking to maximize their earnings. Built using R shiny and deployed to shinyapps.io, this calculator provides quick information on key performance indicators such as if a driver is making money, their effective hourly rate, and how that hourly rate compares to the minimum wage in their state. With reactive indicator boxes, users can quickly assess their earnings relative to their costs, like the cost of gas and insurance for the day. The calculator includes a range of user inputs for detailed exploration of hours worked, miles driven, and take-home pay. Using data visualization, my calculator delivers actionable insights to help drivers optimize their earnings and maximize profitability. With its intuitive interface, this rideshare profitability calculator is a must-have for any driver looking to stay ahead of the competition.

### Tableau Music Chords Visualization

![Piano Chord Chart - Tableau](https://github.com/atseewal/data-science-portfolio/assets/39170343/ca254dbd-d68b-47cd-9245-962337952cf1)

#### Description

Learning piano chords doesn't have to be difficult! Using data visualization, I created a simple way to pull up basic piano chords. It shows which notes are included in the selected chord and lets you change it to a different type of chord. It also uses parameters to change whether the labels on the piano are the finger used to play the note or the name of the note itself.
