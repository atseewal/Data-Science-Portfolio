#### Description

With cancer as a leading cause of death in the United States, the study of its related data is imperative due to the potential patient benefits. This poster examines the SEER research data of reported cancer diagnoses for the incidence of leukemia in young patients in the United States. The aim is to identify variables, such as prior cancers and treatment, with a unique impact on survival time and five-year survival probabilities using visualizations and different machine learning techniques.
